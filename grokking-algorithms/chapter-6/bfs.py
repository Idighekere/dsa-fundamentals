"""
Assuming we have a problem where we want to find our FAceboook freind who is a mango seller.

Those directed connected to us is 1 degree
Those connected to those directly connected to use is 2 degree
and so on.

So we wanna find the shortest path to finding a mango seller.

To do this we have to check all our friends (1 degree) if we don't find, we check their friends and so on.

So we use a queue. when we check a friend and he is not. we add his friends to the end of the queue, remove him from the queue and continue withe next 1st degree friend in the queue.

We use hash table to demonstrate a graph in python.

graph={}

graph['me']=['bob','john','sam']
graph['bob']=['jane','jones']
graph['john']=[]
graph['sam']=['eric']
graph['jane']=[]
graph['jones']=[]
graph['eric']=[]


The array connected to me is my 1st degree connections
then those connected to bob.
john doesn't have any friend
sam has eric as a friend
jane and jones who are friends to bob has no friends
eric who is a friend to sam has no friends

and the double ended queue to demonstrate queues in python.

If a one person is a friend to more than one friend, you don't want to check the person twice or more. you just have to check once and add his friends to the queue.

If we check more than once. it will result into an infinite loop in some cases.

Assuming I have friends A,B and C and friend B has friend C,D and E.

If I check A. he has no firends and not a seller. I move to B.
I check B. he is not a seller. and i add his friends (C,D,E) to the queue. 

The queue becomes [C,C,D,E].
I check C and he is not a seller and i add his friends. which is 'Me', this will result into starting again to check me.
